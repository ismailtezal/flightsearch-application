## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- **`pages`**: This directory contains the main pages of the application. You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

- **`public`**: This directory contains static assets such as images, which can be accessed using `/public` in the URL.

## Font Optimization

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
